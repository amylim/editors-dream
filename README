                    self-balancing binary (AVL) tree & heap used vectors 
                        (instead of nodes and pointers) 
                    
Processes a text file and displays the following information:
  - 10 most frequently used words and frequency count
  - individual tabs labeled A to Z containing:
      - words that started with the given letter
      - frequency count of each word
      - location of each occurance of the word (paragraph and sentence number)
  - number of paragraphs
  - total sentences
  - total syllables 
  - reading level
  - time it took to process the document

The novel "War and Peace" was used to test the storage and retrieval speed 
of the heap and AVL tree.
